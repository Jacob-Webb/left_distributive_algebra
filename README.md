# Left Distributive Algebras and Elementary Embeddings
With this program I added a graph, node, and edge class from Qt to visually represent Dr. Cramer's work on embeddings and left distributive algebras.  
### Motivation
During my short time assisting Dr. Cramer I was able to study some of the theory behind what we were doing, but mostly I was responsible for finding some way to help
Dr. Cramer see what was happening with the program that he had already written.
