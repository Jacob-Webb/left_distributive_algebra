# Left Distributive Algebras and Elementary Embeddings
This program added a graph, node, and edge class from QT to visually represent Dr. Cramer's work on embeddings and left distributive algebras.  
## Motivation
During my short time assisting Dr. Cramer I was able to study some of the theory behind what we were doing, but mostly I was responsible for finding some way to help
Dr. Cramer see what was happening with the program that he had already written. 
## Tech Stack
* C++
* QT
